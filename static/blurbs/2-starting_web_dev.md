# So you want to start web development...
<!---
Why I think getting started with web development is a pain in it's current
state and what advice I would give as you start out.
-->

### Preface

I was lucky enough to be thrown into web development with of my internship at
[Storefront](https://thestorefront.com). I had a set stack to learn, with set
coding practices, etc., so getting started for me was more or less just a part
of my job.

So why do I say it's a pain to start web development, well if you're
starting for yourself, there's so many options of technologies, and so many
opinions about those technologies that Googling starts to not help. I'm not
saying options aren't good, I think it's great now that I know what I'm doing,
but when you're starting out, it isn't always a pleasant place to be in.

### There are good things

I'm going to start with some positives, to not dissuade you from starting
because it's pretty fun once you get into it. One of the greatest things is
you don't actually have to "acquire" users. With apps for iOS or Android, people
have to download your app, there's a barrier of entry. With web, just throw it
up and send a link, done. Getting people to come back is another story, but
hopefully your website has content that gets people coming back.

Another thing is all you really need is internet, something that's connected
to the internet, and a text editor. Notice I didn't say computer, because you
could develop websites on your phone or tablet (just don't do it, it sounds like
a terrible experience). Web development is extremely accessible.

And remember how I was talking about options, it's actually one of the best
things about web development. If you don't like a library, framework, package,
module, plugin, whatever, there's most likely another one that'll be more to
your liking. For example, I recently switched from superagent to axios because
I liked the documentation more, and it had, in my opinion, better ES6 promise
support. This does pose challenges too though, which will segue me into why
I think web development is a pain if you're just starting out.

How to vertically align something with css.

```css
.vertically-align {
  position: relative;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```
