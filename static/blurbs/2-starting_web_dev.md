# So you want to start web development...
<!---
Why I think getting started with web development is a pain in it's current
state and what advice I would give as you start out.
-->

### Preface

I was lucky enough to be thrown into web development with of my internship at
[Storefront](https://thestorefront.com). I had a set stack to learn, with set
coding practices, etc., so getting started for me was more or less just a part
of my job.

So why do I say it's a pain to start web development, well if you're
starting for yourself, there's so many options of technologies, and so many
opinions about those technologies that Googling starts to not help. I'm not
saying options aren't good, I think it's great now that I know what I'm doing,
but when you're starting out, it isn't always a pleasant place to be in.

##### There are good things

I'm going to start with some positives not to dissuade you from starting
because it's pretty fun once you get into a rhythm of things.
