**In Progress**

This branch will be an update to all the core dependencies e.g. webpack, react.

*Technological Changes*

I'm going to find another way to store my photos and blurbs, I'm currently using Docker and have
to rebuild my images everytime I want to add an image or blurb (which is why I never have updates,
I'm lazy). Looking to have a central place I can just store everything and the node client can just
fetch the blurbs and photos every hour, or so, cache it, and the react ui will just know how to
display them.

*Content Changes*

I'm getting back into photography, going to need a better way to display photos. I'm also going to
make it a goal to upload a blurb once a week. This way I'll need to play with new technologies and
not get rusty.
